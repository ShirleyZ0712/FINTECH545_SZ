All the codes are included in the Week03 Directory. 
The whole problem1 solution code is included in problem1.ipynb; the whole problem2 solution code is included in problem2.ipynb; the whole problem3 solution code is included in problem3.ipynb. 
All the codes are written in JupyterNotebook, and the related csv files are included in the same foler, so no need to change the file path when running the codes. 
You probably need to install the packages in the terminal using
pip install numpy 
pip install pandas
pip install scipy 
pip install matplotlib 
pip install seaborn 
pip install statsmodels
pip install sklearn
pip install time
