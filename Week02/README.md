All the codes are included in the Week02 directory.
The whole problem1 solution code is included in the problem1.ipynb
The problem 2.1 and 2.2 solution codes are included in the problem2.ipynb; while problem 2.3 is included in the problem2_x.ipynb
The whole problem3 solution code is included in the problem3.ipynb

All the codes are written in JupyterNotebook, and the related csv files are included in the same foler, so no need to change the file path when running the codes.
You probably need to install the packages in the terminal using
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install statsmodels
